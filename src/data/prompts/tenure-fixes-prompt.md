# Fashion Directory Data Enrichment Task

## Context
We need to add missing tenure data for several prominent fashion designers in our database. The data should be historically accurate and follow our established data structure.

## Data Structure Requirements
Each tenure record must include:
```typescript
interface Tenure {
  id: string;            // Format: "tnr-[unique-id]"
  designerId: string;    // ID of the designer
  brandId: string;      // ID of the brand
  role: string;         // e.g., "Creative Director", "Founder", etc.
  department?: string;   // Use Department enum values
  startYear: number;    // Year the tenure began
  endYear?: number;     // Year the tenure ended (null if current)
  isCurrentRole: boolean; // Whether this is their current role
  achievements?: string[]; // Notable achievements during tenure
  createdAt: string;    // ISO date string
  updatedAt: string;    // ISO date string
}

enum Department {
  JEWELRY = "Jewelry",
  WATCHES = "Watches",
  READY_TO_WEAR = "Ready-to-Wear",
  ACCESSORIES = "Accessories",
  LEATHER_GOODS = "Leather Goods",
  MENSWEAR = "Menswear",
  WOMENSWEAR = "Womenswear",
  HAUTE_COUTURE = "Haute Couture",
  ALL_DEPARTMENTS = "All Departments"
}
```

## Requirements

1. For each designer:

   - Add notable achievements during each tenure

2. Data Quality:
   - All dates must be historically accurate
   - Roles should reflect actual positions held
   - Include significant achievements and contributions
   - Mark current roles appropriately

3. Special Considerations:
   - For founders, create tenures starting from brand establishment
   - For deceased designers, ensure endYear is properly set
   - For current roles, set endYear to null and isCurrentRole to true
   - Include major collaborations and partnerships

## Output Format
Generate the data in a JSON format that matches our Tenure interface structure. Use the following template:

```json
{
  "tenures": [
    {

      "designerId": "[designer-id]",
      "brandId": "[brand-id]",
      "role": "Role Title",

        "Achievement 2"
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-04-12T14:30:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-04-12T14:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Rules
1. All required fields must be present
